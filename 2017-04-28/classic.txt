You play a game with four balls: One ball is red, one is blue, one is green and one
is yellow. They are placed in a box. You draw a ball out of the box at random and
note its color. Without replacing the first ball, you draw a second ball and then
paint it to match the color of the first. Replace both balls, and repeat
the process. The game ends when all four balls have become the same color. What
is the expected number of turns to finish the game?

Extra credit: What if there are more balls and more colors?

### Answer

Should take 9 turns to finish the game.

By simulation (assuming starting with n balls of different colors):
   (For n balls = 3:  4)
    For n balls = 5: 16
    For n balls = 6: 25
    For n balls = 7: 36
    For n balls = 8: 49
    ...

So.... for n balls, probably expect to take (n-1)^2 turns.

Nice!  How to prove???  The analysis below for the n=4 case doesn't generalize
well, since there will be p(n) states for n (partition number for n), and p(n)
grows like exp(C*sqrt(n)).  Probably there is an easier analysis...

### Work:

We have the following states:

(A) 4 distinct colors
(B) 2 balls the same color, 1 ball another color, 1 ball yet another color
(C) 2 balls the same color, 2 other another color (but the same as each other)
(D) 3 balls the same color, 1 ball another color.
(E) 4 balls the same color.

We start in state (A), and immediately transition to state (B).

State (B) can transition to either state (C) or (D), or remain in state (B).
The probability of each transition is:

B->B = 2/12  Must choose both balls of the same color, or first choose one ball
      +4/12	 from the identical pair followed by another ball, in which case
             we remain in state B but with a different color for the pair.
B->C = 2/12  Must choose both of the balls of a different color).
B->D = 4/12  Must first choose one of the different colored balls, then choose
             one from the identical pair.

State (C) can only transition as follows:
C->C = 4/12  Pick both balls from the same pair.
C->D = 8/12  Pick one ball from each pair.

State (D) can transition as follows:
D->C = 3/12  Pick the mismatched ball first.
D->D = 6/12  Pick both balls from the identical triplet.
D->E = 3/12  Pick the mismatched ball second.

Let L(X) be the number of turns it takes to finish the game starting from state X.
Abbreviate E(L(X)) as X.

We have

A = 1 + B
B = (1+B)/2 + (1+C)/6 + (1+D)/3
C = (1+C)/3 + 2*(1+D)/3
D = (1+C)/4 + (1+D)/2 + 1/4
(since E = 0).

  B/2 = 1 + C/6 + D/3
2*C/3 = 1 + 2*D/3
  D/2 = 1 + C/4

  3B = 6   + C + 2D
   C = 3/2 + D
  2D = 4   + C
  
=>
  2D = 4 + 3/2 + D
   D = 11/2
=>
   C = 14/2 = 7
=>
  3B = 6 + 7 + 11
   B = 8
=>
   A = 1 + 8 = 9

Therefore the expected number of turns is 9.
