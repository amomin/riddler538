Three logicians standing in a line, wearing hats selected from a set of
3 identical white hats and 2 identical black hats.  They can only see the
logicians standing in front of them (1<-2<-3).

One person asks "Can anyone tell me what color hat you are wearing?".

No one responds.

Repeats: "Can anyone tell me what color hat you are wearing?".

No one responds.

A third time: "Can anyone tell me what color hat you are wearing?".

One logician replies correctly.

Who answers?  What color hat?  How do they know?

#####

The first logician will declare "I have a white hat".

The only way to get a positive answer to the first questions is if they are wearing
B<-B<-W
in which case (3) can see the two black hats taken, and deduces the white hat
she is wearing.

When (3) does not answer, we also learn that if (1) is wearing a black
hat, then (2) is wearing a white hat.

When the question is asked a second time, we learn that (1) is not wearing
a black hat: otherwise, (2) would have deduced that her hat is white and would
answer.

Therefore, when the question is asked a third time and an answer is given, we know
it was (1) who responds that she is wearing a white hat.
